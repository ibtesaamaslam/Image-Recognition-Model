# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains my first internship project at CodeAlpha, where I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes (airplanes, cars, animals, etc.). This project builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify these images.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 image dataset with 10 classes.
- **Model Architecture**: 
  - Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling.
  - A fully connected dense layer followed by a softmax output layer for classification.
- **Training**: The model is trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 64.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test dataset, and accuracy is calculated.
- **Visualization**: Sample images from the dataset and model predictions are visualized.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the model training script: `python cifar10_cnn.py`.
4. Check model accuracy and predictions on test data.

### Results:
- Achieved a test accuracy of approximately **94%**.
